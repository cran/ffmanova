\title{Creation of a design-with-responses object}
\description{
The function takes an object created by \code{x_Obj} as input and add response values. Further initial computations for prediction and testing is made. 
 }
\usage{
xy_Obj(xObj, Y)
}
\arguments{
  \item{xObj}{object created by \code{x_Obj}}
  \item{Y}{response matrix}
}
 
\details{Traditionally, sums of squares and cross-products (SSC) is the multivariate generalisation of sums of squares. When there is a large number of responses this representation is inefficient and therefore linear combinations of observations (Langsrud, 2002) is stored instead, such as \code{errorObs}. The corresponding SSC matrix can be obtained by \code{t(errorObs)\%*\%errorObs}. When there is a large number of observations the errorObs representation is also inefficient, but it these cases it is possible to chose a representation with several zero rows. Then, errorObs is stored as a two-component list: A matrix containing the nonzero rows of errorObs and an integer representing the degrees of freedom for error (number of rows in the full errorObs matrix).
